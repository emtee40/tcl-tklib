Welcome to the tklib, the Tk Standard Library.  This package is
intended to be a collection of Tcl packages that provide utility
functions useful to a large collection of Tcl programmers.

The structure of the tklib source heirarchy is:

tklib
 +- modules
     +- <module1>
     +- <module2>
     +- ...


The install heirarchy is:

.../lib/tklib<version>
        +- <module1>
        +- <module2>
        +- ...

There are some base requirements that a module must meet before it
will be added to tklib:

* the module must be a proper Tcl package
* the module must use a namespace for its commands and variables
* the name of the package must be the same as the name of the namespace
* the module must reside in a subdirectory of the modules directory in
  the source heirarchy, and that subdirectory must have the same name
  as the package and namespace.  A module may opt to have multiple
  similar packages (ie: clock), in which case the module name must not
  match the packages therein.
* the module must be released under the BSD License, the terms of
  which can be found in the toplevel tklib source directory in the file
  license.terms
* the module should have both documentation (in XML, man, or HTML
  form) and a test suite (in the form of a group of *.test files in
  the module directory).  It is very hard for users to make use of
  modules when neither are present.  Even a stub doc that states the
  available commands is useful.
* the module should adhere to Tcl coding standards

When adding a module to tklib, be sure to add it to the Makefile.in
so it will be installed.  Add a line like:

MYNEWMODULE=mynewmodule

to the list of modules at the top of the Makefile.in, and then add
$(MYNEWMODULE) to the definition of the MODULES variable.  This will
allow users to choose which modules to install by commenting or
uncommenting lines in the Makefile.

Each module source directory should have no subdirectories (other than
the CVS directory), and should contain the following files:

* source code		*.tcl
* package index		pkgIndex.tcl
* tests			*.test
* documentation		*.n, *.xml

If you do not follow this directory structure, the tklib Makefile
will fail to locate the files from the new module.
