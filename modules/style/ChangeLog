	* as.tcl:       Change style::use to call style::${style}::init
	* style.tcl:    procedure, so a simple package require doesn't
	* lobster.tcl:  actually do anything.  Add init to lobster and
	* pkgIndex.tcl: correct namespace usage.  Move lobster and style
	to v0.2.  style::use now takes args to pass to init, eg:
	style::use as -priority 80

	* pkgIndex.tcl: style::as is version 1.2
	* as.tcl: much more elaborate version of style::as that is meant
	to change style across platforms.  This auto-inits, but allows for
	reinitialization with higher priority (needed for CDE/KDE/...).

	* lobster.tcl: Added internal padding to Labelframe.  They look
	better if they have some empty space in them.  Added Scrollbar
	things from as.tcl, which make the scrollbars nicer by narrowing
	them a bit.
