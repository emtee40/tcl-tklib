	* ROOT.msg: Added the missing root catalog, so that at least
	English help text appears when KHIM is not localized.
	* khim.tcl: Corrected a problem where the spinbox did not get
	initialized correctly and so would not spin until the user typed
	in it.  Added fallback in 8.4 for the lack of a root locale.
	Changed the character map to display incrementally at 1-second
	intervals if it's taking too long to look up characters in the
	font substitution (because of performance bugs in that logic on
	Unix).  Added support for the Tile entry widget.

	* khim.man: Put titledesc on a single line. sak's tap file
	  generation bails out otherwise.

	* ChangeLog:     Initial import of the 'khim' (Kevin's Hacky
	* en.msg:        Input Method) package, which provides key
	* khim.tcl:      bindings for inputting international characters
	* pkgIndex.tcl:  on a keyboard that does not support them.
