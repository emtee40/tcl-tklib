	* ROOT.msg: Added the missing root catalog, so that at least
	English help text appears when KHIM is not localized.
	* khim.tcl: Corrected a problem where the spinbox did not get
	initialized correctly and so would not spin until the user typed in it.

	* khim.man: Put titledesc on a single line. sak's tap file
	  generation bails out otherwise.

	* ChangeLog:     Initial import of the 'khim' (Kevin's Hacky
	* en.msg:        Input Method) package, which provides key
	* khim.tcl:      bindings for inputting international characters
	* pkgIndex.tcl:  on a keyboard that does not support them.
