What is new in Scrollutil 1.1?
------------------------------

1. Added the scrollsync widget, designed for scrolling several widgets
   simultaneously (thanks to Paul Obermeier for his proposal and
   testing).

2. Added two demo scripts for the new scrollsync widget.

3. The scrollarea widget now supports the "-takefocus" standard option
   (thanks to Harald Oehlmann for his proposal).

4. The scrollarea "setwidget" subcommand now returns the path name of
   the previously embedded widget.

5. The mouse wheel event handling now restricts the search for the
   registered scrollable widget container that is an ascendant of the
   widget under the pointer to the widget containers within the same
   toplevel (thanks to Harald Oehlmann for his valuable feedback).

6. Several further improvements in the code, demo scripts, and
   documentation.

What was new in Scrollutil 1.0?
-------------------------------

This is the first release.  Thanks to Michael Niehren for discussions on
mouse wheel event handling in scrollable widget containers, as well as
to Paul Obermeier and Thomas Grausgruber for testing the scrollarea
widget.
