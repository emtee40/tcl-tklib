	* Released and tagged Tklib 0.4.1 ========================
	* 

2005-11-10  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* pkgIndex.tcl (::tablelist::Load): Fixed bugs in my hack of
	  pkgIndex.tcl, reported by Csaba. The loaded code is scope
	  sensitive, pcausing the move into the proc to estblish the
	  commands in the wrong namespace. Applied fix by Csaba.

	* Hack: Replaced access to $tableist::version with hardwired
	  version numbers until I figure out how to make this properly
	  accessible to sak.tcl's code scanner. Needed to have tablelist
	  in the generated .tap file.

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Reorganized things a bit. Procedures to remove
	  quoting issues and make code more readable. Unrolled the loops
	  to make code accessible to extraction of name/version
	  information by sak tool.

	* doc/tablelist.html: Applied changes made by Csaba reflecting the
	* README.txt:         fact that tablelist is now in tklib, and
	  that the demos are in a different location.

	* ../../examples/tablelist/: Applied changes made by Csaba
	  reflecting the changed location of the demos in the scripts
	  themselves.

2005-10-03  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Added tablelist to tklib, moved demos to canonical location for
	  examples of tklib modules.
