	* pkgIndex.tcl (::tablelist::Load): Fixed bugs in my hack of
	  pkgIndex.tcl, reported by Csaba. The loaded code is scope
	  sensitive, pcausing the move into the proc to estblish the
	  commands in the wrong namespace. Applied fix by Csaba.

2005-11-02  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Hack: Replaced access to $tableist::version with hardwired
	  version numbers until I figure out how to make this properly
	  accessible to sak.tcl's code scanner. Needed to have tablelist
	  in the generated .tap file.

2005-10-24  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Reorganized things a bit. Procedures to remove
	  quoting issues and make code more readable. Unrolled the loops
	  to make code accessible to extraction of name/version
	  information by sak tool.
