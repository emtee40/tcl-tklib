	* canvas_sqmap.tcl: Removed guards from tilecache invokations in
	  the image methods. Could have prevented insertion of new image
	  into the cache, keeping an old image and making cache
	  inconsistent with the display. This needs cache::async 0.3 to
	  prevent a blow-up in the recursive call to the cache due to
	  recursive call and cleanup of notifications causding failure in
	  the outer call later. This was fixed in v0.3 of the cache::async.
