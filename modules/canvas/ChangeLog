	* canvas_sqmap.tcl (Reconfigure): Streamline internal operations a
	  bit ... I.e. no redraw before the viewport is stabilized, and
	  done only if not already done through the viewport move. Further
	  no irrelevant redraw request when forced through undefined
	  pixelview. At last, do never drop free items. As we configure
	  them to show no image even those not immediately reused are
	  effectively invisible and stay around until needed. This reduces
	  item destroy/create churn rate when we are forcing a full reload.

	* canvas_sqmap.tcl: Removed guards from tilecache invokations in
	  the image methods. Could have prevented insertion of new image
	  into the cache, keeping an old image and making cache
	  inconsistent with the display. This needs cache::async 0.3 to
	  prevent a blow-up in the recursive call to the cache due to
	  recursive call and cleanup of notifications causding failure in
	  the outer call later. This was fixed in v0.3 of the cache::async.

	* New module for extended canvas widgets.

	* canvas_sqmap.man: Extended canvas for map display, based on
	* canvas_sqmap.tcl: square image tiles. Plus examples.
	* pkgIndex.tcl:
